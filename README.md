# Grupparbete HTML/CSS
This repo is a schoolproject given to us in the HTML/CSS section of the education. 
It is the first coding-project and also the first time collabing on git. Even using git is new.

### The project
The task given to us is that we are hired by an imaginary company to build their website. The company is producing company, that deals in productdevelopment.
The webpage shall consist of several html and css files.
There is also some demands:
1. The company has to be introduced, so is the staff.
2. The design shall consider its taget group.
3. The desig should be consequent /The same on all pages)
4. All pages should work on small and wide screens, be responsive.
5. The user should be able to find information on the product.
6. Info on the companys office and opening hours.

We started with an opening meeting setting some rules for the project, and deciding what product to choose. 
We chose Ear-Muffs with voice-equalizer that could filter out voicr frequencies and remove disturbing noice.
Now it was time to start.
To make things clearer we started a [Trello-board](https://trello.com/b/h092tMTS/fe22-html-css-grupparbete)

### The design
Due to the limited time we did a quick research of the Industries. We also conducted interviews.
We then started doing Lo-Fi Prototypes in Figma and contucted some quick user testing. Based on the feedback given to us
and after evaluating it we went on to making HiFi-prototypes.
